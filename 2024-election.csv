    I think bjp will win the 2024 general election. BJP is winning 3 states and they will win Lok Sabha seats in these states, Gujarat, UP, Maharashtra, Bihar, Delhi, Haryana, Karnataka, Uttarakhand. The congress will most likely will win in south states and its alliance partner.

    I have had this question for a long time on my mind, there is less than 10 months now from the next Lok sabha elections. I've been thinking about who is gonna be in power for the next term. I've also got doubts about whom to vote for this time. I've seen a lot of posts against BJP and Modi, saying not to vote for him to vote him out of power from Indian politics. I hate him as much as the next person for half-assed reforms and his silence on some issues (on the media). So who would you think is the best option for the next elections? (Please justify why?)

At the same time, the remainder of polling indicates this is the most likely matchup. How is it possible that the majority of Americans can simultaneously want/not want two unpreferred candidates? Is age alone really sufficient to explain this phenomenon?

    Now the time has come that after the elections of 2024, we will have to say goodbye to democracy in India. Because looking at the atmosphere of the country, it seems that people are not worried about the country or themselves. They only want Ram and religion. So it is obvious that people will vote for BJP, even if they don't, Election Commission and EVM are there to make BJP win.

    There is little to no opposition left at the national level. Congress which is the closest, has lost direction & until they come to terms with it, it may be too late. States ruled by non-BJP struggle & are put under pressure, no matter if they are doing good or bad. The Tejaswis, Thackerays & Kejriwals could make a regional impact but to topple BJP in 2024 is nearly impossible. People have been impacted by the struggling economy, poor government policies, short sighted handling of the pandemic, rising hindutva, communal divide, trashy politics just to name a few. Leaders from opposition parties are jumping ship to join BJP. If the elections do happen in 2024, people may just have two options - Lotus or NOTA. They call themselves People's Republic but China is a single party republic. India won't be far.

    Trump has a dedicated and loyal core, if he runs as independent he will pull at least 1-5% of the vote, guarenteeing a GOP loss. Thr GOP and trump both know this, so he is just sitting on the sidelines until they inevitibly nominate him.

    Between all the trash talking and the hour long diss to congress, Modi promised that he will bring India to number 3 position (don't ask me what that means-economy? poverty?press freedom? who knows). The way he worded it clearly meant that he individually as the PM will do this within the next however many years. Hell, the entire speech was literally announcing his candidacy and denouncing congress (with special attention to the Gandhi family).

    Since 2014, we have seen the rise of hate and ignorance. We have seen how the Modi government has won over people so many times besides failing in crucial aspects of the country such as poverty, defence, economy, communal harmony and the COVID pandemic handling. They have made a fool out of the public, stolen crores through the PM Cares funds, helped Jio become almost a monopoly, corruption is rampant, mob lynchings and cow vigilantism is NORMAL. The list goes on and on.

    I have always wanted to do an in-depth study of India's electoral procedure due to the fascinating complexity with which it works. I want book recommendations that lay out the nuances of the electoral system of India - the historical evolution, the approach post-independence, the changes that have taken place, the trend after shifting to the 21st century, the NDA's current major revival in Indian politics since 2014 and how the 2014 and 2019 elections played out and what has been the emerging trend in India's electoral ideas and formulations for the 2024 elections. I hope to get extensively detailed books - the length is of no consequence - as long as they have well referenced citations that support the facts and the arguments made from them. I would appreciate any help on this and I thank anyone and everyone who respond to this post. Thank you.

I feel Congress party is dying due to their Monarchial politics and unappealing promises to Rural India. The Ram Mandir will be constructed before 2024 and will hugely popularize them. I genuinely feel the worst thing that can happen is Yogi becoming the PM, I feel like Modi is a lot of times better than Yogi. Would love to hear your takes on this?

    With his recent win in UP, it's clear now that he's the 3rd most powerful person in BJP after Modi and shah. Also conquering UP the 2nd time is bound to make him popular allover the country. With modi getting old by the time 2024 elections start there's a slight chance that he might retire, and if he does naturally the next candidate from bjp would be yogi. What all could possibly happen if he becomes PM in 2024. Also what will be your reaction.

    With the way things are going, I have little doubt that the country is being irreparably polarised and Modi is going to come back riding another wave in 2024 elections! But to stop that we need a realistic plan.  I know multiple top RSS functionaries because of my previous job and in my exchanges, with them it's clear they are not going to back down on any of these CAA-NPR-NRC. They will just change the timeline for NRC which I had known before the CAA was even announced as their preferred timeline for the same is 2023-2029. Amit Shah was just trying to test the waters and making an attempt to bulldoze the NRC. I worked alongside Prashant Kishor in 2013-2014 for the BJP and then as an independent consultant directly with the BJP for Assam elections in 2016. Hence have seen them very closely and even now talk to a lot of them. They are on a plan. what are we doing? Any implementable idea as to how that can be done without risking a Civil war or endangering the integrity of the country?

    Hi! 30F, New here but long time anti-MAGA/anti-Trumper. Just curious to see what people think of his chances to actually win in 2024. Maybe I’m here to have my fears quelled… I’m terrified of him being elected (again). What does everyone think? Biden v. Trump rematch? I’m really hoping gen z comes through in the next election. I’m sure it’s been talked about plenty of times here so I apologize for redundancy!

    As a moderate who has never voted for any party, I am leaning towards voting for BJP in 2024. Here's why:

    First and foremost, the alternatives are way worse than what we currently have. An alliance in the center? I don't want a government that moves at a snail's pace. Remember Vajpayee and MMS? If I thought Congress could win a majority on its own, I would vote for them any day; I identify more with their ideology than with BJP's. Modi might be a narcissist, but he's getting stuff done. Infrastructure in India has come a long way since pre-2014. As someone who grew up under UPA-1/2, it's a big difference. Internal security is much better now with improved national security. No more constant worries about bomb blasts in big cities. I'm all for their India-first foreign policy. It makes sense to prioritize our interests. And secondly, the opposition needs a better narrative. What can they offer that Modi isn't already doing? Saving democracy alone won't win elections. It's not like they are not a bunch of corrupt people themselves. Modi is helping his friends, I agree. But if you think attacking Adani will win you elections, I don't see how you appeal to a large majority of people. Bring a better narrative, and I am sold for 2029.

    Everyone is expecting the BJP to win the 2024 GE. However, there is still a chance that the opposition alliance can win the election as seat sharing is not done and manifestos are yet to be released. I think many welfare schemes will be on cards like NYAY(minimum wages), lower taxation, farmer loan waiver, higher MSPs, OPS,  etc. Both the opposition and the ruling party might include all these schemes, although these schemes are offered in every election however this time will be different from other years as this election is a do-or-die for the opposition and the amount will be huge. As evident from recent state elections, people are preferring these schemes.

    All my life, democracy was a given — its continued existence living in perpetuity. For the longest time I thought things would subsidize after Trump got ousted from office. I didn't foresee (this was during the brief period after Biden had won and before the transition had happened) the insurrection happening, I desperately hoped he wouldn't run in 2024. With the recent doubling down of Trump's ""dictator for a day"" comments (including numerous incidents of effusive praising of autocrats), I'm scared. Really scared. That he's going to destroy this country by instituting everything outlined in (Edit: changed 2024 to 2025) Project 2025. Turning the United States into a Trumpian dictatorship.

    I think bjp will win the 2024 general election. BJP is winning 3 states and they will win Lok Sabha seats in these states, Gujarat, UP, Maharashtra, Bihar, Delhi, Haryana, Karnataka, Uttarakhand. The congress will most likely will win in south states and its alliance partner.

    Not a big admirer of Rahul Gandhi, but Indian elections are always about choosing the lesser of the two evils. The way Modi-Shah duo have pushed the country to an abyss is simply terrifying.  I was looking at the distribution of the ruling parties in different state and it looks like BJP is on a pretty shaky ground as compared to 2019. While it's true that state election and central elections are fought on a different level, but I.N.D.I.A. still has a realistic chance if they play their cards well.  This nightmare has to end, we can't let them turn our  country into the next Somalia.

    I have had this question for a long time on my mind, there is less than 10 months now from the next Lok sabha elections. I've been thinking about who is gonna be in power for the next term. I've also got doubts about whom to vote for this time. I've seen a lot of posts against BJP and Modi, saying not to vote for him to vote him out of power from Indian politics. I hate him as much as the next person for half-assed reforms and his silence on some issues (on the media). So who would you think is the best option for the next elections? (Please justify why?)

At the same time, the remainder of polling indicates this is the most likely matchup. How is it possible that the majority of Americans can simultaneously want/not want two unpreferred candidates? Is age alone really sufficient to explain this phenomenon?

    There is little to no opposition left at the national level. Congress which is the closest, has lost direction & until they come to terms with it, it may be too late. States ruled by non-BJP struggle & are put under pressure, no matter if they are doing good or bad. The Tejaswis, Thackerays & Kejriwals could make a regional impact but to topple BJP in 2024 is nearly impossible. People have been impacted by the struggling economy, poor government policies, short sighted handling of the pandemic, rising hindutva, communal divide, trashy politics just to name a few. Leaders from opposition parties are jumping ship to join BJP. If the elections do happen in 2024, people may just have two options - Lotus or NOTA. They call themselves People's Republic but China is a single party republic. India won't be far.

    Between all the trash talking and the hour long diss to congress, Modi promised that he will bring India to number 3 position (don't ask me what that means-economy? poverty?press freedom? who knows). The way he worded it clearly meant that he individually as the PM will do this within the next however many years. Hell, the entire speech was literally announcing his candidacy and denouncing congress (with special attention to the Gandhi family).

    First and foremost, the alternatives are way worse than what we currently have. An alliance in the center? I don't want a government that moves at a snail's pace. Remember Vajpayee and MMS? If I thought Congress could win a majority on its own, I would vote for them any day; I identify more with their ideology than with BJP's. Modi might be a narcissist, but he's getting stuff done. Infrastructure in India has come a long way since pre-2014. As someone who grew up under UPA-1/2, it's a big difference. Internal security is much better now with improved national security. No more constant worries about bomb blasts in big cities. I'm all for their India-first foreign policy. It makes sense to prioritize our interests. And secondly, the opposition needs a better narrative. What can they offer that Modi isn't already doing? Saving democracy alone won't win elections. It's not like they are not a bunch of corrupt people themselves. Modi is helping his friends, I agree. But if you think attacking Adani will win you elections, I don't see how you appeal to a large majority of people. Bring a better narrative, and I am sold for 2029.

I feel Congress party is dying due to their Monarchial politics and unappealing promises to Rural India. The Ram Mandir will be constructed before 2024 and will hugely popularize them. I genuinely feel the worst thing that can happen is Yogi becoming the PM, I feel like Modi is a lot of times better than Yogi. Would love to hear your takes on this?

With modi getting old by the time 2024 elections start there's a slight chance that he might retire, and if he does naturally the next candidate from bjp would be yogi. What all could possibly happen if he becomes PM in 2024. Also what will be your reaction.

    Hi! 30F, New here but long time anti-MAGA/anti-Trumper. Just curious to see what people think of his chances to actually win in 2024. Maybe I’m here to have my fears quelled… I’m terrified of him being elected (again). What does everyone think? Biden v. Trump rematch? I’m really hoping gen z comes through in the next election. I’m sure it’s been talked about plenty of times here so I apologize for redundancy!

    With the way things are going, I have little doubt that the country is being irreparably polarised and Modi is going to come back riding another wave in 2024 elections! But to stop that we need a realistic plan.  I know multiple top RSS functionaries because of my previous job and in my exchanges, with them it's clear they are not going to back down on any of these CAA-NPR-NRC. They will just change the timeline for NRC which I had known before the CAA was even announced as their preferred timeline for the same is 2023-2029. Amit Shah was just trying to test the waters and making an attempt to bulldoze the NRC. I worked alongside Prashant Kishor in 2013-2014 for the BJP and then as an independent consultant directly with the BJP for Assam elections in 2016. Hence have seen them very closely and even now talk to a lot of them. They are on a plan. what are we doing? Any implementable idea as to how that can be done without risking a Civil war or endangering the integrity of the country?

Also there is going to be a big political change/change of indias political structure in 2024. This coincides with the elections that will happen in 2024.

    All my life, democracy was a given — its continued existence living in perpetuity. For the longest time I thought things would subsidize after Trump got ousted from office. I didn't foresee (this was during the brief period after Biden had won and before the transition had happened) the insurrection happening, I desperately hoped he wouldn't run in 2024. With the recent doubling down of Trump's ""dictator for a day"" comments (including numerous incidents of effusive praising of autocrats), I'm scared. Really scared. That he's going to destroy this country by instituting everything outlined in (Edit: changed 2024 to 2025) Project 2025. Turning the United States into a Trumpian dictatorship.
